# 4kDPI
## 4kDPI scales Qt and GTK applications.

#### I wrote this little script because I'm just too lazy to keep copying new BASH scripts, setting them up and making them ready to run, and then checking that everything is OK!
#### It also makes it possible to create a BASH that is ready to run and store it in /user/bin/XYZ, for example.

#### It was tested on Arch Linux as well as on Manjaro under the desktop environment Cinnamon.

#### I hope it is as useful for you as it is for me,
#### have fun with it.
